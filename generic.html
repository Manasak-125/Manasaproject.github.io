							<h3>1) Ask: </h3>
							<p>Very important step in the data analysis process is knowing the problem statement<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Which country is driving more sales?</li>
								<li>What is the sales revenue generated by each category?</li>
								<li>What Sub-category has generated mores sales in each category?</li>
								<li>Knowing the top-10 valuable customers for the business?
								</li>
								<li>Which segment is driving more profit?</li>
								<li>Which country is generating more profits?</li>	
							  </ul>
							  <h3>2) Prepare: </h3>
							  <p>For this project i have gathered the required dataset from kaggle which contains 51,291 records and 21 attributes. </p>
							  <h3>3) Process: </h3>
							  <p>For this project, I am using Microsoft Excel to perform the operations of data Cleaning:</p>
							  
							  <h3>Data Cleaning : </h3>
                            
							  <ol>
								<li>Before starting on the data cleaning it is always required to create a copy of the dataset as a best practice.</li>
								<li>There are no duplicate values in this dataset</li>
								<li>This dataset doesn't contain any blank cells.</li>
								<li>As we are not going to utilize all the attributes for our analysis like region/market attributes we can remove them from the dataset.</li>
								<li>As,we are going to focus on sales perfomance hence each record should atleast have 1 order.Hence, we have to check the data where there is an 0 order.We can remove that record using COUNTIF and FILTER option available in Excel.</li>
								<li>The most tricky part in this process is formating the dates in the Order_date and ship-date columns.As the data has been combined from different sources the date formats are not similar.</li>
								<li>I have solved this using the TEXT-TO-COLUMN feature available in MS-excel which converted all the dates into a single format.</li>
								<li>Client is interested in knowing the average shipping time taken by each shipping mode,for this we have to calculate an additional column which calculates the number of days taken to deliver each order.</li>
								<li>I have calculated this column using the DAYS formula available in excel will calculate number of days between any two given dates.</li>
								<li>I ensure no leading and trailing spaces in text data using power query.</li>
									
							  </ol>
							  <p style="color :rgb(18, 212, 35)">Now the data is ready for analysis!</p> 

							  <h3>4) Analyze: </h3>
							  <ol>
                               <li>From the dashboard we can see that the New York City secures the top position, generating around $2.2 Million while Brazil stands at the 10th position, contributing the sales revenue of approximately $361k. </li>
                               <li>In categories Technology stood first in generating highest sales which contributed around 38% of total sales followed by furniture with 32% and office supplies with 30%.</li>    
							   <li>The top 5 subcategories generating the highest sales revenue for the company are Phones, Copiers, Chairs,Bookcases, Storage. The Phone subcategory takes the lead with approximately $1.7 million in sales, followed closely by the Copiers subcategory with $1.5 millions. The Chairs subcategory secures the third position with sales of around $1.5 million </li>
							   <li>Dashboard also gives details about the top-10 valuable customers who have generated highest revenue.</li>

							<h3>6) Act : Insights and Recommendations.</h3>

							<p> Below are general insights and recommendations from the analysis: </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Any business's long-term success depends heavily on its ability to retain consumers by using a customer-centric strategy.Since we've identified the top 10 customers through analysis, it's critical to keep them around by sending them individualized offers, discounts, or promotions in addition to making appropriate product recommendations based on their tastes and past purchases.</li>
								<li>Phones are the most popular subcategory in the technology sector, which has had strong sales growth.For this reason, the business should step up its marketing initiatives to gain even more market share. It should also make sure that it has enough inventory to meet demand.</li>
								<li>It's crucial to use market research or customer feedback analysis to further investigate the cause of the lowest sales in other categories and make improvements there.</li>
								<li>The Consumer Segment generates the highest revenue, indicating that there might be a higher demand for products in this segment. Therefore, it might be beneficial to focus on maximizing revenue from this segment by analyzing customer preferences, market trends, and sales data to identify the most popular products within this segment.<br>

									Identify ways to increase revenue from the Corporate  and Home Offices Segment: there may be opportunities for improvement such as sales strategies and pricing, Analyzing customer needs and preferences within this segment and identifying gaps in the product offerings can help improve revenue generation from this segment can help identify ways to increase revenue from this segment.</li>
								<li>Customers choose standard class shipping the most because it is less expensive but takes about five days to arrive.Businesses may investigate methods to lower shipping costs for alternative shipping options, which could draw in a larger clientele.</li>
								
							  </ul>

							<p>"Regular monitoring and adjusting the strategies based on customer feedback, market trends, and performance analytics and a customer-centric approach is key to sustained growth for any business".</p>
